This project utilizes JAX and the XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler to fuse an entire training step into a single optimized machine-code executable.🧠 Core Engineering PrinciplesFunctional Programming: Parameters are handled as immutable data structures, allowing for pure function transformations like jax.grad and jax.jit.XLA Compilation: Instead of interpreting Python code, XLA traces the step function and creates an optimized graph where operations are fused at the hardware level.📊 Benchmarking ResultsBy using @jax.jit, the entire forward pass, loss calculation, and gradient update are optimized into a single GPU call.ModeStep Latency (ms)JIT-Compiled Training Step0.204 msMeasured on NVIDIA T4 GPU with a 128x128 input dimension.🏗️ Project Structurecore/model.py: Functional definition of a linear model.core/trainer.py: JIT-compiled value_and_grad training logic.benchmark.py: Performance measurement script with JAX warmup.🚀 Getting StartedBashpip install -r requirements.txt
